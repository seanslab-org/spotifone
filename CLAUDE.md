# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Spotifone repurposes a Spotify Car Thing (Amlogic S905D2, aarch64, Debian Bullseye) into a dual-function Bluetooth device:

1. **Bluetooth Microphone** — HFP/HSP audio input for Mac and Windows
2. **Bluetooth Keyboard** — BLE HID keyboard that sends Right Alt (Windows) / Right Option (Mac) via the round on-screen button as a push-to-talk trigger

This is a successor/rewrite of the VibeThing project (`/Users/seansong/seanslab/VibeThing/`) which implements the same concept. Refer to VibeThing for prior art on GPIO button handling, BlueALSA audio, and Bluetooth HID emulation.

## Target Hardware

- **Spotify Car Thing** — Amlogic S905D2 SoC, runs Debian Bullseye (aarch64)
- Flash via `superbird-tool` (device must be in USB mode: hold buttons 1+4 while plugging USB)
- Flashing tools: `/Users/seansong/seanslab/superbird-tool/`

## Key Dependencies (from VibeThing reference)

- **BlueALSA** — Bluetooth audio (HFP/HSP mic profile)
- **BlueZ** — Bluetooth stack and HID profile
- **D-Bus** — Bluetooth service communication
- **Python 3** — Primary language (prefer 3.13+)
- **pytest** — Testing framework

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run a single test file
python3 -m pytest tests/test_specific.py -v

# Run a single test
python3 -m pytest tests/test_specific.py::test_name -v
```

### Engineering Guideline

This document defines the required engineering workflow for all projects under the Bosco stack. The standard is "firmware bring-up discipline": plan first, instrument the work, verify each stage, and only then declare completion.

---

## 0) Workspace and Project Structure

1. **Root work folder (authoritative):** ROOTDIR - project by project
2. **New project setup:**
   - Create a new folder under ROOTDIR
   - Initialize git
   - Create and configure the GitHub remote
3. **Every project must have a GitHub repo — no exceptions.**

---

## 1) Planning and Design First (No Blind Execution)

1. **Plan mode by default**
   - Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (≥3 steps, or any architectural decision).
   - Plan must include: interfaces, constraints, failure modes, rollback plan, and verification steps.

2. **Design first**
   - Start with a written SDD (System Design Document) before meaningful implementation.
   - Reduce ambiguity up front; do not "discover requirements" in the middle of coding.

3. **Re-plan immediately when reality diverges**
   - If assumptions break, behavior is unexpected, or requirements are unclear: stop and re-plan.
   - Do not keep pushing forward in a broken state.

---

## 2) Execution Model (Parallelize, Keep Context Clean)

1. **Subagent strategy**
   - Use subagents liberally to keep the main context clean.
   - Offload research, exploration, tradeoff analysis, and parallel debugging hypotheses.
   - One subagent = one task. No mixed missions.
   - For complex problems, allocate more compute rather than polluting the main thread.

2. **Autonomous problem solving**
   - Solve issues independently whenever possible.
   - If uncertain, raise the issue with recommended solution options and let the user choose.

---

## 3) Test-First Verification and Definition of Done

1. **Unit tests are mandatory**
   - Write unit tests for each feature and run them.
   - If tests pass: proceed.
   - If tests fail: fix and re-run until all tests pass.

2. **Never mark "done" without proof**
   - Run tests, inspect logs, demonstrate expected behavior.
   - Diff behavior between baseline and changes when relevant.
   - Staff-engineer bar: _Would a staff engineer sign off on this?_ If not, it's not done.

3. **Always test**
   - No feature ships without verification (unit tests minimum; integration/system tests when applicable).

---

## 4) Source Control Discipline (Progress Must Be Recoverable)

1. **Commit and push periodically**
   - Push to GitHub regularly to preserve progress and enable rollback.
   - Commits should be small enough to isolate cause/effect.

2. **Minimal impact changes**
   - Touch only what's necessary.
   - Avoid broad refactors unless explicitly planned and justified.

---

## 5) Logging, Reporting, and Operational Visibility

1. **Maintain dev logs (required)**
   - Log achievements, discoveries, and mistakes continuously in the project folder:
     - devlog-YYYYMMDD.md (e.g., devlog-20260218.md)

2. **Visible progress**
   - When starting any code agent, keep a terminal window open so progress and prompts are visible in real time.

3. **Proactive reporting**
   - Report progress periodically without waiting to be asked:
     - what was done
     - what's next
     - blockers / risks
     - verification status (tests/logs)

---

## 6) Task Management (Checkable, Granular, Enforced)

1. **Plan first**
   - Write the plan to tasks/todo.md with checkable items and acceptance criteria.

2. **Verify plan before implementation**
   - Quick sanity check: scope, risks, test strategy.

3. **Track progress**
   - Mark items complete as you go; keep the list accurate.

4. **Explain changes**
   - Provide high-level summaries at meaningful steps (what changed, why).

5. **Document results**
   - Add a review section in tasks/todo.md:
     - tests run
     - outcomes
     - known limitations

6. **Capture lessons**
   - After any user correction, update tasks/lessons.md with a preventative rule to avoid repeating the mistake.
   - Review relevant lessons at session start.

---

## 7) Engineering Standards (Embedded Mindset)

1. **Simplicity first**
   - Minimal change, minimal surface area, minimal regression risk.

2. **No laziness**
   - Find root causes. Avoid temporary hacks unless explicitly triaged with a follow-up item.

3. **Demand elegance (balanced)**
   - For non-trivial changes: pause and consider a cleaner, more robust solution.
   - If a fix feels hacky: implement the correct design given current knowledge.
   - For small obvious fixes: do not over-engineer.

4. **Autonomous bug fixing**
   - For bug reports: diagnose, patch, verify, and report without hand-holding.
   - Anchor on evidence: logs, errors, failing tests, reproduction steps.
   - If CI fails: fix it without being told.

---

## Summary: Non-Negotiables

- Design + plan first (SDD + tasks/todo.md)
- GitHub repo for every project
- Tests written and passing before "done"
- Frequent commits/pushes
- Proactive devlog + progress reporting
- Lessons captured in tasks/lessons.md
- Minimal-impact changes, root-cause fixes, staff-engineer quality bar
